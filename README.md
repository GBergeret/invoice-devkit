## Testing invoice theme changes locally
The full guide to creating a custom invoice theme can be found here:

Download the devkit, then run a local server (such as MAMP/XAMPP) at the root directory.

Edit the CSS of whatever theme you want to base your theme on. Once you’re happy, paste that CSS into the custom theme area of your FreeAgent account.

The background image file paths in the invoice theme stylesheets match those in the FreeAgent app, so you can simply copy and paste your CSS into your FreeAgent account when you’re happy. Allowing this means that the devkit directory structure must match that of the FreeAgent app, so if you think the directory structure looks a bit strange, now you know why.
